My submission for the GitHub Game Off gamejam 2024, the theme is "Secrets".

Controls:

A or < : Move left

D or > : Move right

Space : Jump

E : Interact

Q : Swap layers (you will see a prompt on levels you can use this!)

Press space when against a wall to wall jump

This game is a 2D platformer where you have to be stealthy! Watch out for cameras, lasers and spotlights. If you get spotted, it's game over!

Each stage has a secret exit, try to find them all! Some are hidden in the dark so can't be seen!
If you find every secret exit, maybe something will happen?

If you're struggling to clear a stage there is a cheat code to unlock all levels...
