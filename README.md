My submission for the GitHub Game Off gamejam 2024, the theme is "Secrets".

Controls:

A or < : Move left
D or > : Move right
Space : Jump
E : Interact
Q : Swap layers (you will see a prompt on levels you can use this!)
Press space when against a wall to wall jump

This game is a 2D platformer, where you are a sneaky dude trying to break out of prison, don't get spotted by the cameras or trip any lasers!

Each stage has a secret exit, try to find them all! Some are hidden in the dark so can't be seen!
If you find every secret exit, maybe something will happen?

There might also be a couple of cheat codes in the game...
